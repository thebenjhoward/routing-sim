# routing-sim
This is a project for CPSC 447 to visualize and simulate the OSPF protocol. The protocol implements Dijkstra's algorithm.

The user will be able to generate a graph of *n*-vertices and observe how routing tables are built up for each graph.

Dependencies:
 - `flask` (to install, type python3 -m pip install flask)

To Run:
